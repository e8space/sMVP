# **sMVP**

sMVP is a lightweight framework for generating javascript frontends based on a Model / View / Presenter design paradigm.
With model-driven view templates and integrated handlers for updating backends via REST-like API calls, it enables fast prototyping, as well as clean structures on complex projects.

sMVP is easy to learn with not too many options to get distracted from.
